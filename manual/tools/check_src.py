"""Check the manual's source notes: every file a note cites exists, and no note cites a line number.

A source note sits under a paragraph and says where its facts come from:

    <!-- src: src/app/JPlacerPreferencesDialog.cpp (the General rows); src/app/JPlacerSettings.h (defaults) -->

It names FILES, and says what to look for in them in words — a function, a setting, a table. It never
gives a line number: a line number is wrong the first time anything above it in the file changes, and
nothing would notice. The file names can go stale too (a file is renamed or deleted), which is what this
catches, at `make manual`, instead of years later.

    python3 manual/tools/check_src.py            # from the repo root; exit 1 on any problem
